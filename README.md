# Car Wash Automation System using TIA Portal

This repository includes a complete PLC automation project developed in **TIA Portal** for managing a fully automated car wash system. It simulates a real-world process of cleaning vehicles using PLC-controlled logic and sensor-based automation flow.

---

## Project Overview

- Automate the process of vehicle washing (entry, washing, drying, exit).
- Simulate user input through sensors and timers.
- Ensure safety and synchronization between system components.
- Visualize process via simulation and video demonstration.

## Technologies Used

| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **TIA Portal v15+** | Siemens software for PLC logic design |
| **S7-1200 PLC** | (Simulation-compatible model) |
| **Simulation Tools** | PLCSIM or custom animation |
| **Programming Language** | Ladder Logic (LAD) |
| **Assets Included** | Video demo, Word documentation, PNG screenshot |

## Features

- **Entry Detection:** Simulated sensor detects incoming vehicle.
- **Sequential Washing:** Step-by-step water spray and soap sequence.
- **Drying Phase:** Fan/dryer simulation after washing.
- **Traffic Light Control:** Entry/exit control via red-green logic.
- **Simulation Preview:** Visual walkthrough available in video.
